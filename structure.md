Your project sounds great for showcasing your skills! Here’s some guidance on structuring your Better Me Lite app professionally, while also keeping it simple and focused on vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1. Project Structure and Pages

Since this is a multi-page vanilla HTML/JS project, you’ll want to organize the different sections of your app across separate HTML pages. Here’s how you might structure it:

a. Homepage (or Dashboard)

    •	Purpose: A main overview where users can see their progress (points for the day/week) and access other parts of the app.
    •	File: You can make this index.html since it’s customary for the index.html to be the default landing page for most apps and websites.
    •	This page would be your “dashboard” for viewing progress and linking to other parts of the app.

b. Add New Habit Page

    •	Purpose: A page where users can add new habits they want to build or bad habits they want to reduce/remove.
    •	File: add-habit.html or something similar.
    •	It will have forms or inputs for adding new habits, and it should link back to the homepage or dashboard.

c. View/Edit Habits Page

    •	Purpose: A list of all the current habits, both good and bad, with the option to edit or delete them.
    •	File: habits.html
    •	This page will display the habits in a simple list and allow users to track their daily habit completion.

d. Progress and Points Page

    •	Purpose: A more detailed breakdown of progress, such as charts or points earned.
    •	File: progress.html
    •	You can keep this separate if you’d like to showcase more in-depth data or a more visual overview of progress.

2. Basic Folder Structure

Here’s an example folder structure to keep everything organized:

/better_me_lite
├── /css
│ ├── global.css // Global styles for your app
│ ├── dashboard.css // Specific styles for your dashboard
│ ├── habits.css // Styles for the habit list and forms
├── /js
│ ├── global.js // Shared JavaScript logic (e.g., navigation, helpers)
│ ├── dashboard.js // Logic for the homepage/dashboard
│ ├── habits.js // Logic for adding, editing, and viewing habits
├── index.html // Homepage or dashboard
├── add-habit.html // Form page for adding new habits
├── habits.html // Page for viewing and managing habits
├── progress.html // Progress and points overview page

3. Content for Each Page

   • Dashboard (index.html):
   • A summary of the user’s progress and goals.
   • Buttons or links to add new habits and view/edit existing ones.
   • Show progress points for the day/week.
   • Add New Habit Page (add-habit.html):
   • A form to add good and bad habits.
   • Buttons to submit and save these habits.
   • View/Edit Habits Page (habits.html):
   • A list of all the user’s habits (both good and bad).
   • Options to edit or remove habits.
   • Daily checkboxes or toggles to mark habits as completed.
   • Progress Page (progress.html):
   • Show a more detailed overview of the user’s habit progress over time (you could keep this page minimal or develop more advanced features like charts later on).

4. Single Responsibility per Page

Each page should have a clear, specific purpose (just like React components do). Avoid putting too much functionality into a single page.

5. CSS and JavaScript Separation

   • Global styles and logic: Have a global.css and global.js file for styles and logic shared across the entire app, such as navigation, fonts, colors, or helper functions.
   • Page-specific files: For example, dashboard.css should only style elements on the dashboard page, and habits.js should handle form validation or tracking logic only for the habit-related pages.

6. Index.html as Homepage

Yes, in traditional web development, index.html is typically the homepage. You can have your dashboard on the index.html file, since it’s often the default landing page for users. In your case, it makes sense to keep the “overview” or “dashboard” on index.html, with links to other parts of the app.

7. Professional Tips:

   • Navigation: Include consistent navigation on all pages (e.g., links or a navbar to move between the dashboard, habit pages, and progress pages). This can be dynamically inserted with JavaScript if you’d like.
   • Usability and Simplicity: Since you’re focusing on simplicity, keep each feature clear and easy to use. Don’t overwhelm the user with too many features on one page.
   • Versioning and Iteration: As you build the vanilla version, keep a clear idea of what you want to showcase (clean, simple functionality). Later, when you move to React, you can take this structure and make it more dynamic with components and third-party libraries.

Summary:

    •	Use index.html as the dashboard/homepage for the user’s progress and overall view.
    •	Separate different concerns (add habits, view habits, progress) into their own HTML pages for clarity.
    •	Use separate CSS and JavaScript files for shared and page-specific logic, to maintain good separation of concerns.
    •	Keep the design simple and user-focused for this version, while planning for the more advanced React version later.
